# Introduction
This is a folder cloned from Udacity's Nanodegree program. This is with no intention to steal the code, but rather as a part of my personally skill display.

The `machine_translation.ipynb` is the main notebook with code written for training different models.

Tensorflow is used as the framework with models being developed in using Keras package.
## Install
- Python 3
- NumPy
- TensorFlow 1.x
- Keras 2.x

## Models
1. RNNs (Recurrent Neural Network) unidirectional
2. RNNs with Embedding Layer
3. Bidirectional RNNs
4. Encoder/Decoder - both have RNN units
5. Encoder/Decoder - with Bidirectional RNN units


## Performance

1. The Encoder/Decoder model achieves an accuracy of `94.5%`
